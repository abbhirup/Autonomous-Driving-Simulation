# Autonomous-Driving-Simulation
Autonomous Driving Simulation using CARLA and Python. 
Here we create a Reinforcement Learning with positive and negative reward functions. The agent is trained on the basis of collisions, lane following and speed control.
Setup CARLA virtual environemnt (we did this with anaconda prompt) and then run train.py file in this environment. Other instructions are included in the train.py file.
